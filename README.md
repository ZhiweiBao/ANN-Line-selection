# ANN (Artificial neural network) - Line Selection model

## Basic information

- Date: Jul. 2020 - Aug. 2020
- Description: The method is mainly used to train the ANN for line selection model in power system. By training the data simulated from PSCAD and MATLAB, the algorithm finds the line that fault occurs.
